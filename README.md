# ImageStitching Instructions
To run this program, the easiest way is to open Matlab and set the "MATLAB" folder as the current directory.
Before running the program, the VLFeat Matlab toolbox must be installed (for the use of the VLFeat implementation of the SIFT algorithm)
The VLFeat Toolbox has been included inside the "MATLAB" folder, so to add the toolbox to the MATLAB search path you just need to run the
following command in the MATLAB command window: "run vlfeat-0.9.20\toolbox\vl_setup".

Note: There is sometimes a bug where running the above command will give an error where the file path is listed as incorrect. Should this occur
you will need to either try the full file path, or re-download the VLFeat binary package from "http://www.vlfeat.org/download.html",
extract the files, and run the command using it's full file path.
